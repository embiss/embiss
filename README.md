- 👋 Hi, I’m @embiss
- 👀 I’m interested in writing a few applications that assist with some of the PBEM wargames I play, 
- mainly from the Wargame Design Studio Squad Battle series
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#
- 💞️ I’m not really looking for collaboration, maybe a hand with getting to grips with OOP
- 📫 You can contact me at: markbiss@gmail.com
